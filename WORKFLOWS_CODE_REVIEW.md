## ⚠️ Issues & Recommendations

### 🔴 High Priority Issues

#### 1. **build-release.yml: Missing npm caching**
**File:** `build-release.yml` (Lines 32, 82, 106)  
**Issue:** macOS job doesn't use npm cache, Windows and Linux do  
**Impact:** Slower builds on macOS  
**Fix:**
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '21.1.0'
    cache: 'npm'  # Add this
```

#### 2. **build-release.yml: Inconsistent error handling**
**File:** `build-release.yml` (Lines 73-119)  
**Issue:** No explicit error handling for build failures  
**Impact:** May leave partial releases  
**Recommendation:** Add explicit failure handling or use `if: success()`

---

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues

#### 3. **ci.yml: Missing timeout for individual steps**
**File:** `ci.yml`  
**Issue:** Only job-level timeout, no step timeouts  
**Impact:** Individual steps could hang indefinitely  
**Recommendation:** Add step-level timeouts for critical steps

#### 4. **build-release.yml: Missing dependencies in clean-release**
**File:** `build-release.yml` (Line 121)  
**Issue:** `clean-release` job depends on all builds, but should handle partial failures  
**Current:**
```yaml
needs: [build-macos, build-windows, build-linux]
```
**Recommendation:**
```yaml
needs: [build-macos, build-windows, build-linux]
if: always()  # Run even if some builds fail
```

#### 5. **check.yml: Jobs could run in parallel**
**File:** `check.yml`  
**Issue:** `lint` and `version-check` are separate jobs but independent  
**Current:** They already run in parallel ✅  
**Status:** Actually fine - this is correct

---

### 🟢 Low Priority / Nice to Have

#### 6. **ci.yml: Artifact retention policy**
**File:** `ci.yml` (Line 111)  
**Issue:** No retention policy specified  
**Impact:** Artifacts accumulate over time  
**Recommendation:** Add retention-days (e.g., 7 days for CI)

#### 7. **build-release.yml: Certificate validation could be improved**
**File:** `build-release.yml` (Line 43)  
**Issue:** Error message in diff command could be clearer  
**Current:** Uses complex diff command  
**Recommendation:** Add explicit error message if checksum fails

#### 8. **All workflows: Add workflow badges**
**Recommendation:** Add status badges to README for visibility

## 📊 Detailed Review by File

### `ci.yml` - Comprehensive CI Workflow

**Overall:** ✅ **Excellent**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Matrix strategy for parallel execution
- ✅ Proper OS-specific prerequisites
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (lint, test, version-check, build)
- ✅ Artifact uploads for manual testing
- ✅ Concurrency control
- ✅ Proper environment variables

**Improvements Needed:**
1. ⚠️ Add artifact retention policy
2. ⚠️ Consider adding step timeouts for critical operations
3. ⚠️ Add Linux dependencies check (already good with wmctrl/xdg-utils)

**Score:** 92/100

---

### `check.yml` - Quick Checks

**Overall:** ✅ **Excellent**

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Fast feedback loop
- ✅ Proper caching
- ✅ Uses `npm ci`
- ✅ Clear documentation comments
- ✅ Jobs run in parallel correctly

**Improvements Needed:**
1. ⚠️ Could combine into single job since they're independent (but current structure is fine)
2. ⚠️ Consider running on multiple Node versions for compatibility testing

**Score:** 95/100

---

### `build-release.yml` - Release Workflow

**Overall:** ✅ **Good**, needs minor fixes

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Proper macOS code signing setup
- ✅ Good secret management
- ✅ Certificate validation with checksum
- ✅ Release cleanup logic
- ✅ Proper conditional execution (only on merge)

**Issues Found:**
1. 🔴 Missing npm cache on macOS job (Line 32)
2. 🔴 No error handling strategy for partial builds
3. ⚠️ clean-release should run even if builds partially fail
4. ⚠️ Certificate validation error could be clearer

**Improvements:**
1. Add `cache: 'npm'` to macOS Setup Node step
2. Add `if: always()` to clean-release job
3. Improve error messages in certificate validation

**Score:** 82/100

---

## 🔒 Security Review

### Security Strengths:
- ✅ Minimal permissions set
- ✅ Secrets properly used (not exposed)
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Proper secret scoping in build-release.yml

### Security Recommendations:
1. ✅ **Permissions are appropriate** - `contents: read` is minimal
2. ✅ **Secrets are secure** - Properly referenced, not logged
3. ⚠️ Consider adding `pull-requests: read` if needed for PR context

---

## 🚀 Performance Analysis

### Current Performance:
- **check.yml:** ~2-3 minutes (fast feedback)
- **ci.yml:** ~15-20 minutes per platform (parallel = ~20 min total)
- **build-release.yml:** ~30-40 minutes (sequential)

### Optimizations Implemented:
- ✅ npm caching
- ✅ Parallel jobs in check.yml
- ✅ Matrix strategy in ci.yml
- ✅ Concurrency control
- ✅ `npm ci` for faster installs

### Additional Optimizations Possible:
1. ⚠️ Add caching for electron-builder (if supported)
2. ⚠️ Consider using `actions/cache` for node_modules (though npm cache should handle this)

---

## 📋 Recommendations Summary

### Must Fix (Before Production):
1. 🔴 Add npm cache to macOS job in build-release.yml
2. 🔴 Add `if: always()` to clean-release job for partial failure handling

### Should Fix (Recommended):
